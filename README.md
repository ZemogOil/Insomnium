# Insomnium
RPG based around the SCP-6200 File

This is a game that I hope to make based off of the very interesting story of SCP-6200.

## Main Story
1. Exit Testing Chamber, find out about the fall of mankind.
2. A few newsites still post online, however radio broadcasts, television and anything else that is transmitted by over-the-air signals have ceased. This prevents the creatures from knowing where the people are hiding. If people are transmitting from radio towers and television satellites, the creatures will know where to strike.
3. Original story contains 7 survivors, out of all of these people, three of them participated in a previous SCP capture mission, where events that unfolded forced the MTF to kill off whatever they found. This creature is what sparked the collective human consciousness project.
4. As survivors within the lab facility die, mistrust builds, as many of the deaths lead to the idea that one of the survivors among them are actually working with the creatures. Examples include, possibility of letting them infiltrate multiple times, killing off other members when no one else is looking and purposefully decieving others so that they turn on their team and kill each other.

## Part 1: Revelations
Here is where the survivors will find out that the world has become havoc. Videos and news stories are being played back as they show people grotestquely sprouting bone wings and dying, only to rise again and kill off the living. The effect is invectious, as humans that didn't immediately turn, did so as soon as they were killed off by the other necrohorrors that would now roam the majority of the city. This is where the first encounter with the undead starts, though none actually ever see what happens as none of the footage ever properly shows what they look like.

## Part 2: Divulgance
This first "calm" part of the game is meant so that the main character, whoever is telling the story (I believe that it is a person by the sur name: Rainer) would explore the floors and available facility. Here they will find items that would be considered useful for their survival, such as flashlights, weapons (if implemented), food( as health items, if implemented), and what each of the rooms contain. This can ranged from surgical tables, dissection labs, archives, filing rooms, surveilance rooms and among other rooms. There will be other good stuff for those that like lore, this includes offices where you may have access to different files for different experiments taking place, creatures being studied, or even phenomenum that hasn't been disclosed to the plubic yet.

This part is also where everyone gathers and sees the very terrifying sight of numerous undead just stading outside of the lab's alarm system.

## Part 3: Betrayals
In short, this is where most of the insecurities among the different survivors comes forth. People being sneaking and suspicious. There will be deaths here, be them from the survivors or the enemy idk yet, but they will come eventually.

## Part 4: Background
This is an interesting juicy part (at least I hope it turns out juicy). There will be important background information that is revealed, and when talking to some of the other survivors, you will get more of an idea of what you are actually dealing with. After this revelation, the game should start to close out, I just don't know how quickly or shortly.

## Part 5: Ending
The Big Bad Evil Person (BBEG) is finally revealed! The player will have to taken them out, and once they do, the ending should trigger. Past this point, there is nothing else really written in the SCP files for this event. Therefore, exploring further out and other places is out of the question for now.
