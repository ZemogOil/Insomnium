# Insomnium
RPG based around the SCP-6200 File

This is a game that I hope to make based off of the very interesting story of SCP-6200.

The main idea of the story is that a group of scientists, field engineers, and some sort of ex-armed forces members are some of the last remaining living humans on earth. Their mission before the worldwide disaster was to test out a system in order to connect every human subconsciousness together, trademarked Noosphere in the SCP document. One of the members had been previously infected from a different mission, where an unknown entity, that's a hivemind, was casuing problems near someplace similar to Arizona. Out of the entire armed forces, only Sinclair, one of the team members survived. The overall team was able to subdue the opposition, but a few of the creatures had infected Sinclaire. These creatures, aside from being a hivemind, are parasites, and infest hosts in order to live. The game's win condition isn't to figure out who it is, but to simply play out the story and defeat the BBEG. In the original story, there isn't much of a fight, as the creature is still in the human's body, a simple shotgun shot to the back of the head, plus many more consecutive shots to the out of spite, managed to  kill the creature. In game, I will most likely make it so that you have to hit them more than a few times.
